It gave off a strange feeling..." />

    <!-- Ending Special Thank You -->
    <credits1 value="You overcame all the obstacles of Sunday Night Plumbin !"/>
    <credits2 value="4 years this project has existed.\nSunday Night Plumbin', an FNF mod made out of passion for the fandom and for all the creations around the famous mustached plumber.\nThe whole dev team put their hearts into it, because we love FNF and Mario.\nIn fact, Silent, Heartless and Poltergeist were created without the director even knowing, by part of the original team who simply wanted to have fun and share their passion (this was revealed only a week before the mod's release).\nCreate what you like, have fun, and don't be afraid to try new things, that's what truly matters...\nThank you so much for playing our game, and see you next time.\n\n\n-The Plumbers / SNP Dev Team"/>
